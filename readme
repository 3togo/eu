eu is a no-bs pfm viewer.

the name `eu' is chosen because it is short and extremely fast to type
on a dvorak keyboard (homerow left hand, right hand is presumably copy-
pasting the file name argument with the mouse). don't like it: rename
your binary.

eu needs next to no resources (one uint8_t frontbuffer, just the resolution
of the window), all files are mmapped and worked on directly. this is also
the reason why so far it only supports pfm, but other formats should
be possible, too. heavy compression will make it very inefficient though.

eu is (c) 2014 johannes hanika and published as GPLv3.
